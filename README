Convert Java source code to ActionScript 3

* Convert java syntax to ActionScript syntax (i.e. 'int i=0;' becomes 'var i:int=0;'
* Convert basic java objects to ActionScript equivalents (native types, String, Exception, Map, etc.)
* Convert overloaded methods to "uniquely named" methods (original-name$hash)
* etc.

To build, just run ant.  A single "executable" jar file will be produced, that can be run as:

	java -jar Java2AS3.jar -i <java-source-dir>

Where <java-source-dir> is a folder containing the original java source code.

After building you can run some tests as:

	ant test

The resulting ActionScript files are in the as3 folder.
